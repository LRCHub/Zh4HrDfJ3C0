[00:22.15] I can't explain the reason why the love I had is gone
[00:24.67] My heart has lost all feeling, I've been crying too long
[00:27.17] Can't even think no more. I can't feel or see my skin
[00:32.50] Lost in a world of sorrow, can't ignore the pain
[00:35.18] Surely someone other than me must have been to blame
[00:37.43] It's crazy that I never knew it all
[00:39.32] Could fade away
[00:46.82] 
[00:42.58] All our hopes and dreams, what did they mean?
[00:45.08] All those things we did weren't as they seemed
[00:47.50] And the past, out there, it waits for us
[00:50.11] Teeth shining in the dark, waiting for us
[00:53.17] All of my sorrow, all my loneliness, if they were gone
[00:58.24] When the night dies in the dark
[01:00.86] I'd dream of you instead of singing this song
[01:23.36] 
[01:03.22] Searching for your smile, if I knew it could be found
[01:05.75] I wouldn't give it up, I wouldn't have drowned
[01:08.26] Remembering the words you say in every conversation
[01:10.89] The only way to cure the pain, the suffering
[01:13.58] Now, I only focus on the reason that I'm living
[01:16.07] I always knew that kindness wasn't like it seemed
[01:18.67] So, if you see me smiling every time I see you crying
[01:21.16] At last, you'll understand I don't know what shame means
[01:49.16] 
[01:23.73] Melodies of a nightingale
[01:26.01] As I tear apart my college diploma
[01:28.56] Rising up, and to the stars they sail
[01:31.14] Eating up the memory of the past
[01:47.14] 
[01:54.68] Call it a phase, all this rage that we're feeling
[01:57.05] Got us seeing that revenge is the way
[01:59.39] Let the adults sing
[02:00.53] Even though the thought is so empty
[02:02.19] They just like the fact that they're singing
[02:04.54] With a hollowed-out soul, with the strength of youth
[02:07.49] And I realize that my nails are coming loose
[02:10.16] I forgot the reason why I liked
[02:12.33] The rain or why I liked my favorite song
[02:32.33] 
[02:15.37] Everything revolving in my heart, in my mind
[02:17.77] Missing all the people and the times gone by
[02:20.35] But there's one feeling that I can't forget
[02:24.26] After all, I'm thinking about you
[02:40.76] 
[02:35.56] We meet up in the city, just imagine for a second
[02:38.26] A dreamlike conversation, building each and every sentence
[02:40.77] Would you understand me? Just smiling and laughing
[02:45.73] Imagine you and me, inside a screen, meeting up
[02:48.40] Remembering the memories, regrets, and all the pain
[02:51.63] Even now, I still love you
[02:53.56] And if I could, I would just do it all again
[03:15.56] 
[02:56.35] If I could bear to be a grown-up adult
[02:58.69] The sadness and the bruises would just fade away
[03:01.24] And finally, we understand the words that really matter
[03:03.72] The tears on my face would just dry away
[03:06.55] Do you know you spin my mind into a spiral pattern
[03:08.80] Can't take another day, can't take another morning light
[03:11.68] The thought of growing up scared me away
[03:14.08] The thought of getting tough had me afraid
[03:35.08] 
[03:16.62] The melody of a nightingale
[03:19.03] My uniform turns into a piece of trash
[03:21.52] Rising up, and to the stars they sail
[03:24.02] Eating up the memory of the past
